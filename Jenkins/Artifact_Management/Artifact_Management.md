**Storing Build Artifacts**

When we talk about storing build artifacts, we're referring to the process of saving the output of your build process (e.g., compiled binaries, Docker images, libraries) in a centralized repository. 
This is crucial to ensure the availability, traceability, and consistency of artifacts throughout the lifecycle of an application. Popular Artifact Repositories:
- Nexus: A popular artifact repository manager that can store, manage, and retrieve build artifacts. It supports various formats, such as Maven (for Java), npm (for JavaScript), and Docker images.
- Artifactory: Another widely used artifact repository that works similarly to Nexus but with more advanced features, like high availability and integration with CI/CD pipelines. It supports a broad set of packaging formats (Maven, npm, Docker, etc.).
- AWS S3: While not a traditional artifact repository, Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) is often used to store artifacts (e.g., tarballs, ZIP files, Docker images) due to its scalability and durability.
- Docker Hub: A container registry used specifically for storing and sharing Docker images, often used in CI/CD pipelines for containerized applications.

Why is it important?
- Centralizes storage: Artifacts are stored in one place, making it easy to retrieve them later.
- Prevents "works on my machine" problems: Ensures that the same artifact is used across all environments (development, staging, production).

**Versioning & Tagging Releases**

Versioning and tagging are essential in artifact management because they ensure that the correct version of the artifact is deployed to different environments and prevent confusion or errors during deployment.
- Versioning: Each artifact is assigned a unique version number (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.1`). This version number helps in tracking which version of the application is deployed, tested, or running in production.
  - Semantic Versioning (SemVer): This is a popular versioning strategy, where version numbers consist of three parts: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. For example:
    - `1.0.0`: Initial release (major)
    - `1.1.0`: New features (minor)
    - `1.1.1`: Bug fixes (patch)
- Tagging Releases: Tagging is a practice used to mark a specific commit or artifact in your version control system or artifact repository. This is typically done after a successful build or release, and the tag is often used to identify production-ready versions.
  - For example, after a successful build, a Docker image could be tagged as `myapp:v1.0.0`, which would ensure that the `v1.0.0` version is used consistently in all environments.
 
Why is it important?
- Traceability: Versioning ensures you can trace which version of an artifact was deployed, making it easier to debug or roll back if needed.
- Reproducibility: You can recreate exactly the same environment with the same artifact by pulling the specific version from the repository.

**Artifact Promotion Strategies**

Artifact promotion refers to the process of moving an artifact through different environments in a controlled manner (e.g., from development to staging to production).
This is crucial in ensuring that the artifact being deployed has passed all necessary quality checks and works as expected in different environments.

Common Artifact Promotion Strategies:
- Continuous Integration (CI) & Continuous Delivery (CD):
  - In a typical CI/CD pipeline, artifacts are first stored in a "development" or "snapshot" repository after successful builds. These artifacts are then tested in various stages (unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests) and promoted to higher-level repositories (e.g., "staging" or "production") if they pass all tests.
- Environment-based Promotion:
  - Snapshot: The initial version of the artifact created during development (e.g., `myapp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`). These artifacts are unstable and meant for testing.
  - Staging: After the artifact passes automated tests and review, it is promoted to the staging repository (e.g.,`myapp-1.0.0-rc1`), where it is deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
  - Release: Once fully validated, the artifact is promoted to a release repository (e.g., `myapp-1.0.0`), which indicates it's ready for production.
- Promotion with Quality Gates: Artifacts can only be promoted to higher environments (like staging or production) if they meet predefined quality gates (e.g., unit test coverage, performance benchmarks, security checks). This ensures that only validated and approved artifacts make it to production.

Why is it important?
- Controlled Deployments: Artifact promotion provides a structured process to ensure that only thoroughly tested and validated artifacts are deployed to production.
- Minimized Risk: By promoting artifacts through testing environments first, you reduce the risk of introducing bugs or issues into production.
- Consistency: The same artifact version moves through environments, ensuring that no environment-specific issues arise.
