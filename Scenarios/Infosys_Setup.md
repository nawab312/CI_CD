### Could you walk me through the CI/CD process for your application deployment, considering the environments you work withâ€”Dev, Staging, and Production? I'd also like to know how you're using Jenkins, S3 for artifact storage, and WebLogic on EC2 for hosting. ###

### Development (Dev) ###
- It is where the initial code is written and changes are tested by individual developers.
- We store the Java application code in a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
- Each developer works on their respective feature branch.
- **Source Code Management**: Our branching strategy is:
  - main: Represents the production-ready code.
  - staging: A stable branch used for pre-production testing
  - dev: For ongoing feature development.
  - hotfix/*: For emergency fixes in production.
- **Triggering the Build:**
  - Once a developer is done with a feature, they create a pull request (PR) to merge their feature branch into the dev branch. Jenkins automatically triggers a build when a change is pushed to the dev branch.
- **Build Process:**
  - Code Checkout: Jenkins pulls the latest code from the dev branch in GitHub.
  - Build the Application: We use Maven to compile the Java code and package it into a WAR or JAR file.
  - Unit Tests: We run unit tests using JUnit or TestNG to ensure that basic functionality is correct.
  - Static Code Analysis: We run SonarQube to perform static code analysis for any potential issues or vulnerabilities.
  - Artifact Storage: The resulting WAR/JAR file is stored in AWS S3 as our artifact repository. We use S3 to ensure that we can easily fetch and deploy the latest build to Staging and Production.
- If all tests pass, the developer will create a PR to merge the dev branch into staging.

### Staging Environment###
- Staging environment is where we perform integration and user acceptance testing (UAT) before moving to production.
- **Triggering the Build:**
  - When the pull request from dev to staging is merged, Jenkins is triggered again to deploy the code to Staging.
- **Build Process in Staging:**
  - Code Checkout: Jenkins pulls the latest code from the staging branch in GitHub.
  - Build the Application: We rebuild the Java application using Maven.
  - Unit and Integration Tests: We run both unit tests and integration tests to validate that the entire application works as expected.
  - Artifact Fetching: Jenkins fetches the previously stored WAR/JAR file from AWS S3.
  - Deploy to Staging:
    - We deploy the application to WebLogic running on EC2 instances.
    - The deployment can be automated using Ansible or through Jenkins using deployment scripts
  - End-to-End Tests: In the staging environment, we also run Selenium or Cucumber tests for automated functional testing.
  - If the application passes UAT and all tests, the QA team will approve it, and we will create a PR to merge the staging branch into main for production deployment.
 
### Production Environment ###
- It is where the application is deployed for end users.
- **Triggering the Build:**
  - When the pull request from staging to main is merged, Jenkins triggers the final deployment to Production.
- **Build Process in Production:**
  - Code Checkout: Jenkins pulls the latest code from the main branch in GitHub.
  - Build the Application: Similar to the previous stages, we rebuild the application using Maven.
  - Unit and Integration Tests: Run full suite tests to ensure everything works after the latest changes.
  - Artifact Fetching: The WAR/JAR file is pulled from S3.
  - Deploy to Production:
      - Deploy the application to the Production WebLogic environment on EC2 instances.
      - We use Blue-Green or Canary deployments to ensure zero downtime during the production rollout.
  - **Post-Deployment Tests:** After deployment, we run basic smoke tests to ensure that the production environment is stable
 
### Hotfix Workflow ###
- **Triggering a Hotfix:**
  - If a critical issue is found in Production, we create a hotfix branch off the main branch. This branch will directly address the production issue.
- **CI/CD Process for Hotfix:**
  - Create a hotfix/* branch from main.
  - Jenkins will trigger the build and deploy it to Production.
  - After a successful hotfix deployment, the hotfix/* branch is merged back into main and staging to ensure consistency across environments.
