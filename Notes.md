**Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single project. It involves: 
- Frequent code commits to a shared repository.
- Automated build and testing processes.

**Continuous Delivery (CD):** Extends CI by automating the release process, ensuring that software can be deployed at any time. Stages include automated deployment to staging environments, testing, and final release.

**Continuous Deployment (CD):**
- Goes a step further than Continuous Delivery.
- Every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production without manual approval.

**How do you resolve dependencies in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline?**
Dependency resolution is a critical step to ensure reproducibility and consistency across different environments. The approach depends on the technology stack, but in general, we follow these best practices:
